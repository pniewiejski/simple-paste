## ymmm... but why?

Why does this repo exist? Well, I'm glad you asked handsome stranger! To tell you the truth, since
the whole `#stayhome` thing had started, I had some spare time to catch up with a few books &
articles I wanted to read for some time. When I was going through the awesome
[system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) article, I found this
system's design question -
[Design Pastebin.com](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer/blob/master/solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md).
I guess that was the initial spark that lead to creation of this repo. 💁‍♂️

Note that this is supposed to be only a sandbox for me to play around with a few things at once.

## How do I run it?

Good question! I'll gladly explain this once I know it myself! And in all seriousness, there is
hardly anything to run at this point. So, hold on for a moment 😰, and in the meanwhile enjoy this
cat-typing-on-a-computer-gif.
